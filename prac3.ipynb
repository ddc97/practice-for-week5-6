    "- a. True. The second player will play optimally and rationally as usual, and so is perfectly predictable up to ties. Knowing thebequally good moves that opponent will make does not change the value of the game to the first player.    \n",
    "- b. False. In a partially observable game, knowing the second player’s move tells the first player additional information about the game state that would otherwise be available only to the second player. For example, in Kriegspiel, knowing the opponent’s future move tells the first player where one of the opponent’s pieces is; in a card game, it tells the first player one of the opponent’s cards.\n",
    "- c. False. Backgammon is a game of chance, and the opponent may consistently roll muchbetter dice. The correct statement is that the expected winnings are optimal. It is sus-pected, but not known, that when playing first the expected winnings are positive evenagainst an optimal opponent."
